# A2 Metro Trip Planner

Express + React app

Description:
The Metro Trip Planner is a web application that allows users to plan a metro route by selecting a start station and an end station. Once both stations are chosen, the app retrieves the route between them and displays an interactive map view showing the full path, including all stops along the way. This provides a simple, visual way to explore metro connections and travel paths.
